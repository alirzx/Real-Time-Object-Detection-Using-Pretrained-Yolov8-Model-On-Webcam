# Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLOv8 and Webcam YOLOv8

This project provides a user-friendly GUI application for performing real-time object detection using a webcam and the YOLOv8 model. It allows users to detect objects in real-time, count the number of objects, and save the annotated video. The application supports multiple YOLOv8 model sizes, making it flexible for different use cases.

# Features
Multiple YOLOv8 Models: Choose from different YOLOv8 model sizes (yolov8n.pt, yolov8s.pt, yolov8m.pt, yolov8l.pt, yolov8x.pt) for varying levels of accuracy and speed.

Real-Time Object Detection: Detect objects in real-time using your webcam.

Object Counting: Count the number of detected objects and display the count on the video feed.

Save Annotated Video: Save the annotated video to your local machine.

FPS Display: Display the frames per second (FPS) on the video feed.

User-Friendly GUI: Built with tkinter, the interface is intuitive and easy to use.

# Use Cases
Real-Time Surveillance: Monitor and detect objects in real-time.

Object Counting: Count the number of specific objects in a video stream (e.g., people, cars, animals).

Video Annotation: Automatically annotate video streams with bounding boxes and labels.

Education and Research: Learn and experiment with YOLOv8 and real-time object detection techniques.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher

torch (PyTorch)

ultralytics (YOLOv8)

opencv-python (OpenCV)

Pillow (PIL)

tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

#Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/alirzx/Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-YOLOv8-and-Webcam.git
cd Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-YOLOv8-and-Webcam
Install the required Python packages:

pip install torch ultralytics opencv-python Pillow
Usage
Run the application:


python webcam_object_detection.py
Select a Model:

Use the dropdown menu to choose a YOLOv8 model (default is yolov8n.pt).

Select Save Path:

Click the "Select Save Path" button to choose where to save the annotated video (default is output_video.avi).

Start Webcam:

Click the "Start Webcam" button to begin real-time object detection.

The video feed with bounding boxes, labels, object count, and FPS will be displayed.

Stop Webcam:

Click the "Stop Webcam" button to stop the video feed and object detection.


Start Webcam
Start the webcam for real-time object detection.

Real-Time Detection
Real-time object detection with bounding boxes, labels, object count, and FPS.

Save Video
Save the annotated video to your local machine.

Supported Models
The application supports the following YOLOv8 models:

Model	Description
yolov8n.pt	Nano (fastest, lowest accuracy)
yolov8s.pt	Small
yolov8m.pt	Medium
yolov8l.pt	Large
yolov8x.pt	Extra Large (slowest, highest accuracy)
